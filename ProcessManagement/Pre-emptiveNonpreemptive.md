### **1. Overview of CPU Scheduling in Operating Systems**
- **Purpose of Scheduling**: Ensures optimal CPU utilization by managing the execution order of processes.
- **Primary Types of Scheduling**: 
  - **Preemptive Scheduling**: Allows interruption of a running process, enabling high-priority tasks to execute sooner.
  - **Non-Preemptive Scheduling**: A process runs to completion (or until it voluntarily relinquishes the CPU), reducing system control over process priority.

### **2. Preemptive Scheduling**
- **Definition**: Allocates CPU for limited time, potentially interrupting the process to allow a higher-priority task to execute.
- **Trigger Conditions**:
  - Process moves from **running to ready** or **waiting to ready**.
- **Common Algorithms**:
  - **Round Robin (RR)**, **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)**, and **Priority Scheduling (preemptive)**.
- **Example Scenario**: In an emergency response system, a critical alert process would preempt less urgent tasks.

#### **Advantages**
1. **Reduced Response Time**: Lower wait for high-priority processes.
2. **Improved CPU Utilization**: Shorter tasks fit between larger ones.
3. **Better Resource Sharing**: Processes receive CPU in manageable segments, reducing monopolization.
4. **Multitasking Efficiency**: More effective in a multi-programming environment.

#### **Disadvantages**
1. **Context Switching Overhead**: Frequent switching leads to extra CPU cycles.
2. **Starvation Risk**: Lower-priority tasks may indefinitely wait if higher-priority tasks continually enter.
3. **Complex Implementation**: Requires additional logic and resources to handle interruptions.

### **3. Non-Preemptive Scheduling**
- **Definition**: A process retains CPU until it either completes or enters a waiting state (e.g., for I/O operations).
- **Trigger Conditions**:
  - Process terminates or voluntarily enters a waiting state.
- **Common Algorithms**:
  - **First Come First Serve (FCFS)**, **Shortest Job First (SJF)** (non-preemptive), and **Priority Scheduling** (non-preemptive).
- **Example Scenario**: In batch processing, tasks run sequentially without interruption to simplify process flow.

#### **Advantages**
1. **Simple Implementation**: Easier to implement and manage.
2. **Lower Overhead**: Fewer context switches save system resources.
3. **Predictable Execution**: No interruptions allow smooth process flow.
4. **High Throughput for Long Tasks**: Processes with long CPU bursts finish without frequent pauses.

#### **Disadvantages**
1. **High Waiting Time for Shorter Tasks**: Tasks with shorter CPU bursts may be delayed.
2. **Rigid Resource Allocation**: No flexibility to prioritize urgent tasks.
3. **Response Time Delay**: Slow response for newly arriving, high-priority tasks.

### **4. Key Differences Between Preemptive and Non-Preemptive Scheduling**

| Parameter           | **Preemptive Scheduling**                           | **Non-Preemptive Scheduling**                             |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Interruptions**   | Process can be interrupted mid-execution           | Process runs to completion or enters waiting state       |
| **Starvation**      | High priority may cause starvation for low priority| Large burst time tasks can delay shorter tasks           |
| **Overhead**        | Higher (context switching)                         | Lower, as there’s less switching                         |
| **Flexibility**     | More flexible (responsive to priority changes)     | Rigid (tasks run uninterrupted)                          |
| **Cost**            | Higher due to context switching                    | Lower due to fewer interruptions                         |
| **CPU Utilization** | Higher, as resources are optimally reallocated     | Lower, as CPU stays with a single task till completion   |
| **Waiting Time**    | Lower for high-priority processes                  | Potentially higher if large CPU bursts dominate queue    |
| **Response Time**   | Lower for urgent processes                         | Higher due to uninterrupted execution                    |
| **Scheduler Role**  | Active, controls execution order based on priority | Passive, follows process-defined order                   |

### **5. Exam-Specific Additional Points for Competitive Advantage**

1. **Commonly Asked Algorithms and Examples**:
   - **Round Robin** and **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)** are frequently used preemptive examples.
   - **First Come First Serve (FCFS)** and **Shortest Job First (SJF)** illustrate non-preemptive scheduling.
   - **Question Tips**: Often, questions test your understanding of the algorithms' behavior in given scenarios.

2. **Key Metrics and Calculations**:
   - **Response Time**: The time from submission to the first response by the CPU.
   - **Turnaround Time**: Total time taken from submission to completion.
   - **Waiting Time**: Time a process spends waiting in the ready queue.
   - **Formulas**:
     - **Turnaround Time (TAT)** = Completion Time - Arrival Time
     - **Waiting Time (WT)** = Turnaround Time - Burst Time
   - **Question Tips**: Be prepared to calculate these metrics for given scheduling scenarios.

3. **Potential Exam Scenarios**:
   - **Starvation Resolution**: Questions may ask how algorithms like Aging (gradually increasing priority) can prevent starvation.
   - **Throughput Optimization**: Understand why preemptive scheduling may improve throughput in environments with mixed burst times.
   - **Response in Real-Time Systems**: Preemptive scheduling is better suited for real-time systems where response time is critical.
  
4. **Context Switching and System Performance**:
   - **Question Tips**: Competitive exams may query the downsides of excessive context switching, highlighting resource usage in preemptive scheduling.

5. **Preemptive vs. Non-Preemptive Exam Questions**:
   - **Example**: "Which scheduling type would you choose for a real-time system? Why?" (Answer: Preemptive, due to its flexibility and quick response to high-priority processes).
   - **Scenario-based Questions**: Given a list of processes with burst and arrival times, determine waiting and turnaround times under both scheduling types.

### **6. Conclusion and Application Tips**
- **Preemptive Scheduling** is suited for systems with real-time requirements or mixed workloads needing responsiveness.
- **Non-Preemptive Scheduling** is ideal for simpler systems where tasks don’t frequently change priority, or where system simplicity is preferred over multitasking efficiency.

- **Choosing the Right Algorithm**:
  - Understand the workload: For instance, **Round Robin** is suitable for time-shared systems, while **FCFS** works best when task order and fairness are the focus.
  - **Practice Question**: Given different system requirements, select an appropriate algorithm and justify its suitability.
